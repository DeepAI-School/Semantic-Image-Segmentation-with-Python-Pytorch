# Semantic Image Segmentation with Python and Pytorch

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying every pixel in an image into predefined classes or categories. For example, in an image with multiple objects, we want to know which pixel belongs to which object.

The goal of semantic segmentation is to assign a semantic label to each object in the image. This is a challenging task because it requires a high level of detail and accuracy, as well as the ability to handle variations in scale, orientation, and appearance.
